# 🧩 Problem vs Solution

### ❗ The Problem
During the intense placement phase, we realized the need for a **personal assistant/guide** to navigate us through the journey. Self-study and self-improvement are powerful—but **staying organized and motivated** on our own path proved challenging. We needed a platform that could help us:

- Structure our preparation
- Track our progress
- Push us in the right direction
- Offer guidance without switching across multiple platforms


### ⚔️ Them vs Us

| **THEM**                                                                 | **US**                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multiple scattered methods for placement preparation                     | ✅ **All-in-One** solution within a single platform                                              |
| Different websites serve different needs (e.g., LeetCode, LinkedIn)      | ✅ Centralized access to all tools—**track, grow, and stay focused**                            |
| Newer platforms introduce AI assistance                                  | ✅ AI support integrated **in your native language** for better personalization and accessibility |
| Lacks seamless organization and self-tracking                            | ✅ **Organized self-assistance** and progress tracking built-in                                 |

## 🗄️ Databases

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/mongodb-47A248?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white" alt="MongoDB" />
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/firebase-FFCA28?style=for-the-badge&logo=firebase&logoColor=black" alt="Firebase" />
</p>

We have chosen to use **_NoSQL databases_** due to their scalability, speed, and ease of structuring data. This approach aligns well with the dynamic and rapidly growing nature of our application.
- **_MongoDB:_**  Stores all core data related to users, problems, companies, and other essential components of the website. NoSQL structure makes the data more scalable and easier to manage as the application grows.
- **_Firebase:_** Used for **_user authentication_**. Supports secure and seamless sign-in methods, including: Google, Microsoft, Phone Number. Enhances both **_security_** and **_user experience_** during the authentication process.

- **_Node.js Server_**  : Used **_Node.js_** to fetch and serve data related to users, companies, blogs, placements, and more from **_MongoDB_**. All frontend components retrieve their data via this server.  
  ➤ Server runs on: `http://localhost:5000`
- **_Python Flask for Chatbots_**  : Integrated all chatbots on the website using **_Python Flask_**. These bots are powered by **_Gemini_** and **_OpenAI APIs_**, and are seamlessly connected to the front end via Flask routes.  
  ➤ Chatbot server runs on: `http://localhost:5002`
- **_Python Flask for Face Recognition_**  : Implemented a face recognition module using **_OpenCV_**, **_MLlib_**, and **_PCA_**, with a dedicated Flask server. Images are sent to this server, processed, and authenticated based on facial recognition results.  
  ➤ Face recognition server runs on: `http://localhost:5001`
- When you download and run this repository locally, the application will be hosted on `http://localhost:5000`, `http://localhost:5001`, and `http://localhost:5002` by default.
- Used **_Express.js_** to handle routing and middleware for the **_Node.js_** server, ensuring efficient communication between the frontend and backend services.

> 🛠 Built using the open-source project: _**web-ui**_

> Web-Ui _**REPO:**_ `https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui`, have used the API from the open-source project for the web-based-bot part of our project.
<details> <summary><strong>Click to Expand Full Description Of BOT</strong></summary> <br>
  
This bot leverages a browser-UI based method to automate and perform the below tasks.
  
1. **Information Seeking:**
- Ask the bot to summarize statistics or graphs from the placement or any other page.
- Request a summary of any specific page on the site.
- Search for a specific problem (e.g., Two Sum), and the bot will:
  - Check if it has been solved
  - If not, extract and provide relevant resources
2. **Site Navigation:**
- Direct the bot to move across different pages.
- Ask it to go to a specific page or section.
- Be context-specific: request the bot to jump to a relevant section within an application page.
3. **Configuration & Operations** Command the bot to perform operations like:
- Signing in
- Signing up (you can provide your email and password)
- Applying to a recently posted company

</details>

#### Demo Of Web-Based Bot:

1. **PROMPT-1:** (_Simple_)
```
1.) open a tab, and in that open these URL: http://localhost:5174
2.) Click sign-up button
3.) Then click sign-up using google, and know when a new window pop-up. 
4.) In the text field type "01nilavarasan@gmail.com" and click the submit button
```
<h4 align="center"><strong><ins>Execution Of Above PROMPT</ins></strong></h4>

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb21e530-232d-423e-9f1a-1667dee727fa

2. **PROMPT-2** (_Complex_)
```
1.) open a tab, and in that open these URL: http://localhost:5174
2.) Know click the sign-in button, and in that page click the sign-method where we use camera sign-in.
3.) Know in that portal , wait till a human face appear in the screen. If appeared then wait 5 seconds. And then click capture button.
4.) Know a new page will be loaded, then click companies button present in the sidebar.
```

- In the similar way we can ask the Bot some query, and the bot executes the query by travelling/traversing/using , by interacting with the browser elements(scrool, click, read, write etc).
> As of know these bot is not integrated with the Main Website, but the bot works completely fine. Asking any query the bot fullfills it, just the integration of this browser-ui-model-API, need to be configured with the Bot in our application. And also the below pipe-line flow also need to be finished using langchain, the flow of prompt from the BOT.

1. This chatbot functions like any general-purpose assistant, capable of handling a wide range of user queries. It supports both general knowledge questions and personalized queries based on user-specific data.
- Users can ask questions on a variety of topics, including:
  - **Learning topics:** “What is Big Data?”, “Explain the Two-Sum problem”, “What is the time complexity of this approach?”
  - **Problem-solving guidance:** Debugging, Concept explanations, Strategy recommendations

> This Part works completely fine, integrated with **_Gemini-API_**.
2. Also since the bot is powered by **_RAG_**, where to the **_RAG_** some of the data are also feed like. Like stats/data of the placement/company of all the years, also it has aceess to some of the data of the user. Not all data are shared to the RAG, since some data are sensitive. So only some of the neccesary features of the company/stats/current-uer are stored in the vector-DB, using this data the specific-user can ask questions like
- "How many company have came this year with more then 12-lLPA", "How many jobs is posted by Google this year".
- "How much problems i have solved in medium level", "How much companies i have applied", "How many companys i am elgibile , but have not applied".

A spereate vector-DB is present for each user, so the bot can answer based on that Specific-User. -----> All this are done using RAG, and the pipeline is log/streamlined through langsmith. The data are automatailally updated in the RAG, when ever there is update in data of the user/company/placement. <--- ALl this pipiline are monitored using langsmith. 
> This part is **IN-PROGRESS NOT FINISHED**, have finished the pipeline. Just need to intergrate the pipeline with the backend, then with frontend.

> Query For General-purpose part is finished( 1. is finished), but query based on the website data (2. not finished).
