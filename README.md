| Different websites serve different needs (e.g., LeetCode, LinkedIn) | âœ… Centralized access to all toolsâ€”**track, grow, and stay focused** |
| Newer platforms introduce AI assistance | âœ… AI support integrated **in your native language** for better personalization and accessibility |
| Lacks seamless organization and self-tracking | âœ… **Organized self-assistance** and progress tracking built-in |

### The Solution

We present **PlacementPrep** â€“ your **intelligent placement companion**.

**What it offers:**
- A centralized platform designed to act as your **personal assistant**
